IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:
-------------------------

1. Category Classification (Priority: High)
   Issue: Category accuracy is 66.7%, below 80% threshold
   Suggestions:
   - Add more diverse training examples for category embeddings
   - Enhance category descriptions with more detailed keywords
   - Improve chain-of-thought prompts for category classification
   - Consider adjusting similarity thresholds in vector search

2. Subcategory Classification (Priority: High)
   Issue: Subcategory accuracy is 66.7%, below 75% threshold
   Suggestions:
   - Add more subcategory-specific training examples
   - Enhance hierarchical context in subcategory prompts
   - Review subcategory descriptions for clarity
   - Consider parent category context in subcategory classification

3. Confidence Scores (Priority: Medium)
   Issue: Average confidence is 0.432, below 0.7 threshold
   Suggestions:
   - Improve embedding quality with more representative examples
   - Enhance LLM prompts with clearer instructions
   - Add confidence calibration based on historical performance
   - Consider ensemble methods for more reliable predictions

4. Specific Category Confusion (Priority: Medium)
   Issue: "بيانات المنشأة" often confused with "الإرسالية" (1 times)
   Suggestions:
   - Add distinguishing examples between "بيانات المنشأة" and "الإرسالية"
   - Enhance description clarity for "بيانات المنشأة" category
   - Review and improve keywords for "بيانات المنشأة"
